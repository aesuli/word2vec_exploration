A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/anon/pen/QjXvoy.

 Force driven layout in the awesome D3 JavaScript library. The mouse hides as you click and drag on the elements. Using the equally awesome solarized palette. I'm using this in one of my lynda.com classes.

Forked from [Ray Villalobos](http://codepen.io/planetoftheweb/)'s Pen [D3.js Force Layout with Labels ](http://codepen.io/planetoftheweb/pen/CdqcD/).
